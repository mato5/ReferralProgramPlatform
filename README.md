## Referral Program Platform

### Project description :

A web application to manage referral programs. Referral programs enable us to send invitation links to potential users of some software (i.e. target application). Such a user should be, upon registration, able to send further invitations according to the configuration of the particular program. The platform should also maintain a waiting list of people interested in using the target application. The platform should allow us to add more users from the waiting list, spread new invitations or setting the number of referrals an existing user is able to send (both individually and in batches). We should be able to visualize the data about referrals in a tree chart, selecting according to geo-location, unused referrals, etc.
